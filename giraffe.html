                            <img src="images/giraffe-large.jpg"/>
    <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances </p>
    <p>Giraffes are hunted for their meat, coat and tails. The tail is prized for good luck bracelets, fly whisks and string for sewing beads. The coat is used for shield coverings. Habitat destruction and fragmentation are also threats to giraffe populations.</p>
    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffe , right next to the insect house.</p>
